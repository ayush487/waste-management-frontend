          <b>Waste management</b> or <b>waste disposal </b>includes the
          processes and actions required to manage waste from its inception to
          its final disposal.This includes the collection, transport, treatment,
          and disposal of waste, together with monitoring and regulation of the
          waste management process and waste-related laws, technologies, and
          economic mechanisms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Waste can be solid, liquid, or gases and each type has different
          methods of disposal and management. Waste management deals with all
          types of waste, including industrial, biological, household,
          municipal, organic, biomedical, radioactive wastes. In some cases,
          waste can pose a threat to human health. Health issues are associated
          with the entire process of waste management. Health issues can also
          arise indirectly or directly: directly through the handling of solid
          waste, and indirectly through the consumption of water, soil, and
          food. Waste is produced by human activity, for example, the extraction
          and processing of raw materials. Waste management is intended to
          reduce the adverse effects of waste on human health, the environment,
          planetary resources, and aesthetics.
        </p>
        <p>
          The aim of waste management is to reduce the dangerous effects of such
          waste on the environment and human health. A big part of waste
          management deals with municipal solid waste, which is created by
          industrial, commercial, and household activity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Waste management practices are not uniform among countries (developed
          and developing nations); regions (urban and rural areas), and
          residential and industrial sectors can all take different approaches.

          <u>Waste Management in India</u>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Waste management is an increasingly pressing issue in India, a country
          that boasts a rich cultural heritage, rapid urbanization, and a
          burgeoning population. With over 1.3 billion people, India generates a
          substantial amount of waste daily, making effective waste management a
          paramount concern. This article delves into the multifaceted
          challenges and promising opportunities that define waste management in
          India, offering insight into ongoing efforts to forge a sustainable
          and eco-conscious future.

          <b>Challenges of Waste Management in India:</b>
        </p>
        <ol className={classes["ol-problem-list"]}>
          <li>
            <b>Rapid Population Growth :</b> India's remarkable population
            growth rate exacerbates the problem of waste management. The sheer
            quantity of waste produced daily overwhelms existing disposal
            systems.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Lack of Infrastructure:</b> Many Indian cities grapple with
            inadequate waste management infrastructure. This deficiency extends
            to the insufficient number of waste collection points,
            transportation facilities, and waste treatment plants.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Informal Waste Sector:</b>A substantial portion of waste
            management in India is conducted informally. Ragpickers and waste
            workers often toil in hazardous, unregulated conditions, with
            limited access to safety measures and healthcare.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Mixed Waste Streams:</b> A pervasive issue is the co-mingling of
            various waste types, including organic, plastic, and hazardous
            materials, making recycling, composting, and disposal far more
            intricate.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Awareness and Education:</b> There is a crucial need for enhanced
            awareness and education among the general populace regarding waste
            segregation at its source. Many individuals are unaware of the
            importance of separating recyclables, organic waste, and
            non-recyclable materials.There is a crucial need for enhanced
